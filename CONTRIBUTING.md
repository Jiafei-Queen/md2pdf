## Guidelines

- **No frameworks** — This project stays pure HTML/CSS/JS
- **No build step** — Must work by opening `index.html` directly
- **Keep it simple** — One file per concern (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **Test exports** — Any change to styles must be tested in PDF, HTML, and image exports
- **Dark & Light** — All visual changes must work in both themes
- **Mobile friendly** — Test on small screens

## Adding a New Style

1. Add the style object to `STYLES` in `app.js`:
   ```js
   mystyle: { name: 'My Style', dark: false, bg: '#fff', css: `
     .markdown-body { /* your overrides */ }
   `},
   ```
2. Add an `<option>` to the `#styleSelect` in `index.html`
3. Add an `<option>` to the WebMCP form `#wmcpConvert` in `index.html`
4. Test in both dark and light app themes
5. Test PDF and HTML exports

## Adding a New Template

1. Add the template string to `TEMPLATES` in `app.js`
2. Add a `<button data-template="key">` to the templates dropdown in `index.html`

## Code Style

- Use `const` / `let`, never `var`
- Single quotes for strings
- 4-space indentation
- Keep functions small and focused
